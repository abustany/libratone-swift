# libratone-swift

Unofficial implementation of the Libratone device control protocol.

This is a Swift port of [my Rust
implementation](https://github.com/abustany/libratone-rs). It comes with a
simple CLI that shows how to use the API, and that allows sending basic
commands to your device.

This package is used by [my unofficial Libratone iOS app, Libretone](//github.com/abustany/Libretone-iOS).
